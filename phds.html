	<p class="title">Ridurre le features biomediche necessarie al machine learning sfruttando il contesto biologico</p>
	<p class="description">
		The biomedical sector has generated an immense amount of data over the past decade, and it shows no signs of diminishing. <br>
		On the contrary, it continues to grow steadily. <br>
		The declining costs associated with obtaining and analyzing biological samples from individuals to study complex diseases have made it possible to construct datasets large enough to leverage sophisticated mathematical techniques, including artificial intelligence, ranging from machine learning to deep learning. <br>
		The concept behind this PhD project involves developing a technique for feature selection or feature extraction that can reduce the amount of information required by machine learning models to make predictions, while considering the biological context. In addition to improving predictions and reducing the time required to build the model, this would also enable clinicians to understand the key biological characteristics that the model focuses on to distinguish the specific pathology. <br>
		Consequently, clinicians can then concentrate on determining the most effective treatment to adopt. <br>
